      <h2>What is the issue?</h2>
      <p>Mental health disorders are becoming much more prevalent in recent years. Especially with anxiety disorders which lead to many other mental health issues through it. If it is left without treatment. The main diagnosis of disorders began in the 1980s with the rise of anxiety issues beginning around 2007. The main countries being affected are, Portugal, Iran, and Lebanon then followed by Australia, Western Europe and then the Americas. Even with all the work being put into the issue it still worsens. This is shown with about 17% of Australians being diagnosed with a type of anxiety disorder. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 the aftermath has been shown in many people which caused a big rise in mental health issues.</p>

      <h2>What are the effects?</h2>
      <p><strong>Short:</strong> In short term mental health issues cause distress, behavioral changes, increased risk of substance abuse (drugs) and increased risk of committing self harm. Many issues can arise from this in future.<br><br>
      <strong>Long:</strong> The long-term effects caused from mental health issues, with increased rates of chronic health illness from long times spent not socialising. Especially with people with depression it can increase rates of drug abuse. This can cause difficulty with education or work and stays with people for a long time when untreated.</p>

      <h2>What is the solution?</h2>
      <p>Something that could be done would be to start programs to educate everyone, not just people in schools but adults alike to notice these issues. Make a more affordable way of obtaining therapy or counseling (especially in America) that doesn’t require an insurance plan. Try to reduce the influence of social media on people, not by controlling it but by managing how mental health disorders are seen. With the government funding programs would be much easier to introduce into many people’s lives.</p>

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>Personally, mental health issues are something many people experience and can be something really close to people. Even I experience these issues at times. What I want is to create an awareness for people to help others.</p>
